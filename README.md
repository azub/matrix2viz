==========
 
### I'm in the process of copying things over, adding documentation, existing issues and roadmap. It'll take me two weekends to make this ready for consumption. I'll try to finish demo website first so that you can play around and look at existing functionality. (It's possible do so now by checking project out and running locally in the browser).
